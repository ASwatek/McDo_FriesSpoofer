# McDonald FriesHit Minigame bot
Sends packet to the FriesHit game server, the goal is to stay #1 in the leaderboard to get a free iPhone X (or a stupid Samsung S10 when you end up #2).


# The response of the game developers:

![lwprod email response](https://ferib.dev/img/blog/mcdo_lwprod_response.png)

*As you know, it's not possible to protect against all cheaters. We try to deffend ourself against cheaters by implementing extra checks.*

*You must understand that we should erase your score, but feel free to play the game legit.*

# Me after reading that:

Let see if their server side checks indeed work ;)
